Financial data for a stock is fetched from [`Yahoo Finance API`](https://yfinance-python.org/reference/index.html) which is feed into a Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate investment recommendation. The orchestration of tasks and data is done via AI Agents framework [`CrewAI`](https://www.crewai.com/) and presented in a user-friendly [`Streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/) interface.
